# The Office Episode Recommendation system

This is the underlying code for this webapp that I programmed in R/shiny: https://moritz-muller.shinyapps.io/TheOffice_EpisodeRecommender/

I webscraped the underlying data from this amazing website that contains all transcripts of all The Office (US) episodes: https://transcripts.foreverdreaming.org/viewforum.php?f=574
Furthermore, I webscraped the IMDB website to get ratings for every episode of the office.
